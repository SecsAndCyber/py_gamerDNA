# py_gamerDNA

This project provides python bindings to the basic gamer social networking functions and image hosting of www.gamerDNA.com

It does not allow the creation of accounts, that step must be performed manually. 
This is both due to technical issues (CAPTCHA) as well as a design decision to not expose the service to automated attacks or account spam.

Sorry, code that was written after 12AM does not have comments.
